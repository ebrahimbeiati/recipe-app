## Getting Started üöÄ

To get the **React-Node Recipe App** running locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **PostgreSQL** database
- A [Spoonacular API key](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) for fetching recipe data

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebrahimbeiati/recipe-app.git
   cd react-node-recipe-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the **backend** directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - **Configure Spoonacular API**:
     - Obtain your [Spoonacular API key](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
     - Add the API key to the `.env` file:
       ```bash
       API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key
       ```

   - **ElephantSQL Setup**:
     - Create a PostgreSQL database instance on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
     - Copy the **connection string** provided by ElephantSQL.

   - **Prisma Setup**:
     - Open the `.env` file and replace the `DATABASE_URL` value with your ElephantSQL connection string.
     - Initialize Prisma and generate the Prisma client:
       ```bash
       npx prisma init
       npx prisma generate
       ```

   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port defined in your `.env` file).

3. **Frontend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the **frontend** directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install the frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   The frontend application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in your `vite.config.js` file).
